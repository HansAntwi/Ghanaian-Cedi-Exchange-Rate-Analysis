GHANAIAN CEDI MAKES A COMEBACK: ANALYSING THE APRIL-MAY 2025 SURGE

Over the past few weeks, the Ghanaian Cedi has shown surprising strength against major currencies like the USD, GBP, EUR, and CAD. I analysed the trend using data from January 2025 to 5th may, 2025 from the Bank of Ghana data centre. Based on my recent analysis of exchange rate trends, the turning point appears to have occurred around April 22nd, 2025, when the cedi began appreciating steadily. Initially, the reasons behind this surge were unclear, prompting a deeper dive into recent economic developments.

Questions That Needed Answers:
•	What policies or interventions are behind this recovery?
•	Is the IMF’s support package taking effect?
•	Have fiscal or monetary tightening policies been recently implemented?
•	Is BoG engaging in direct forex interventions?

Why Is This Analysis Important?
Understanding currency trends is critical for hedging and strategy for businesses and investors. The Cedi’s rebound, if sustained, could signal opportunities in Ghana’s markets—but is this a short-term correction or a long-term trend?

Key Findings:
•	During the period, the USD lost 7.14% of its value against the Cedi, the highest percentage among all the currencies under study.
•	CNY lost 6.93% during the period
•	CAD lost 3.03% during the period
•	GBP lost 0.49% during the period
•	Although EUR also experienced a fall from April 22 to May 5, for the period under review it saw an appreciation of 1.9%
 
What Could Be Behind These Trends?
1.	Gold Purchase Agreements: Ghana has expanded its gold purchase initiative by securing agreements with nine additional mining companies to buy 20% of their gold output. This move aims to strengthen the country’s gold reserves and help stabilize the cedi.

2.	Establishment of GoldBoD: The government has created a public entity, GoldBoD, to oversee the artisanal gold industry and supervise large-scale operations. This entity will be the sole buyer and exporter of gold, conducting all transactions in the local currency, thereby bolstering the cedi.

3.	Central Bank Interventions: The Bank of Ghana supported the foreign exchange market with US$264.4 million in March 2025 to preserve the stability of the cedi. This intervention reflects the growing size of Ghana’s gross international reserves and the ability to provide forex liquidity in the local market.

4.	Monetary Policy Adjustments: In a surprising move, Ghana's central bank raised its main interest rate by 100 basis points to 28% in March 2025. This decision aims to address persistent inflation and reflects a more hawkish stance to combat rising prices.

5.	Tax Reliefs and Economic Policies: The 2025 Budget Statement introduced strategic tax reliefs for traders and new steps to stabilize the cedi. These efforts aim to relieve financial pressures on businesses and restore confidence in the national economy.

6.	External Factors: A weaker USD globally (due to Fed rate cuts or risk-on sentiment) may have indirectly lifted the Cedi.

CONCLUSION:
The cedi's recent appreciation appears to be the result of a combination of strategic government interventions, including bolstering gold reserves, tightening monetary policy, and implementing supportive fiscal measures.
